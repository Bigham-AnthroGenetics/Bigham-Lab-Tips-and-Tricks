# Some useful databases

* Ensembl: https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html
    * Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species
* UCSC Genome Browser: https://genome.ucsc.edu/
    * Interactive view genome
* Gnomad: https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/
    *  Aggregating and harmonizing both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and making summary data available for the wider scientific community.
